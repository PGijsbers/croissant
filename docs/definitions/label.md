# `ml:label`

In ML, a **label** refers to the value being predicted i.e. the desired
output of a model.

While often referring to discrete values (e.g.`{"cat", "dog"}`), a label can also refer to a continuous value, for example a predicted temperature or price.

**Warning**
Because labels often refer to discrete values ,
and because the general definition of a label outside of ML and CS is
"a kind of tag to idendify an object", the term "label" is also often used to
designate an
[enumeration value](/howto/enumerations) or a class ([definition](definitions/class)). To avoid ambiguities and confusion,
the Croissant format only use the term "label" when it matches the above
definition.
