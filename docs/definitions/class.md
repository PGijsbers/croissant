# `ml:class`

In ML, a **class** (or category) is a possible value a discrete **output**
variable can take. It is therefore used in the context of classification (or
categorization) problems.

Classes allow to differentiate (or to classify)
the data – or a subset of the data – into a **finite** set of options.
The different possible options an output variable can take are often
referred to as classes.

**Warning**
Classes and labels, although sometimes used indistinctively, do not share the
exact same definition. Be sure to check the
[label definition](/definitions/label). A class is the possible value a label
may take, but a label is not necessarily a class.

Classes are [defined using enumerations](/howto/enumerations)
