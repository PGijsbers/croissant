# `ml:class`

In ML, a **class** (or category) is a possible value a discrete **output**
variable can take. It is therefore used in the context of classification (or
categorization) problems.

Classes allow to differentiate (or to classify)
the data – or a subset of the data – into a **finite** set of options.
The different possible options an output variable can take are often
referred to as classes.

**Note**
Classes and labels, although sometimes used indistinctively, do not share the
exact same definition. Be sure to check the
[`ml:label` definition](/definitions/label). A class is the possible value a
`ml:label` may take, but a `ml:label` is not necessarily a class.

See the [howto define labels documentation](/howto/labels) to
use all kind of labels, including classes.
